PSALMS 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me
  relief when I was in distress. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!
  
2. O men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame? How long will you
  love vain words and seek after lies? Selah
  
3. But know that the LORD has set apart the godly for himself; the LORD
  hears when I call to him.
  
4. Be angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and
  be silent. Selah
  
5. Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD.
  
6. There are many who say, "Who will show us some good? Lift up the light
  of your face upon us, O LORD!"
  
7. You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and
  wine abound.
  
8. In peace I will both lie down and sleep; for you alone, O LORD, make
  me dwell in safety.

PSALMS 34
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. I will bless the LORD at all times; his praise shall continually be in
  my mouth.
  
2. My soul makes its boast in the LORD; let the humble hear and be glad.
  
3. Oh, magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together!
  
4. I sought the LORD, and he answered me and delivered me from all my
  fears.
  
5. Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be
  ashamed.
  
6. This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him and saved him out of all
  his troubles.
  
7. The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and delivers
  them.
  
8. Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good! Blessed is the man who takes
  refuge in him!
  
9. Oh, fear the LORD, you his saints, for those who fear him have no
  lack!
  
10. The young lions suffer want and hunger; but those who seek the LORD
  lack no good thing.
  
11. Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
  
12. What man is there who desires life and loves many days, that he may
  see good?
  
13. Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit.
  
14. Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
  
15. The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous and his ears toward
  their cry.
  
16. The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the
  memory of them from the earth.
  
17. When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears and delivers them out
  of all their troubles.
  
18. The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.
  
19. Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him
  out of them all.
  
20. He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken.
  
21. Affliction will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will
  be condemned.
  
22. The LORD redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take
  refuge in him will be condemned.

PSALMS 64
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; preserve my life from dread of
  the enemy.
  
2. Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, from the throng of
  evildoers,
  
3. who whet their tongues like swords, who aim bitter words like arrows,
  
4. shooting from ambush at the blameless, shooting at him suddenly and
  without fear.
  
5. They hold fast to their evil purpose; they talk of laying snares
  secretly, thinking, who can see them?
  
6. They search out injustice, saying, "We have accomplished a diligent
  search." For the inward mind and heart of a man are deep!
  
7. But God shoots his arrow at them; they are wounded suddenly.
  
8. They are brought to ruin, with their own tongues turned against them;
  all who see them will wag their heads.
  
9. Then all mankind fears; they tell what God has brought about and
  ponder what he has done.
  
10. Let the righteous one rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him! Let
  all the upright in heart exult!

PSALMS 94
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. O LORD, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth!
  
2. Rise up, O judge of the earth; repay to the proud what they deserve!
  
3. O LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult?
  
4. They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast.
  
5. They crush your people, O LORD, and afflict your heritage.
  
6. They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless;
  
7. and they say, "The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob does not
  perceive."
  
8. Understand, O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise?
  
9. He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does
  he not see?
  
10. He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke? He who teaches man
  knowledge--
  
11. the LORD--knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath.
  
12. Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O LORD, and whom you teach out
  of your law,
  
13. to give him rest from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the
  wicked.
  
14. For the LORD will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his
  heritage;
  
15. for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart
  will follow it.
  
16. Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against
  evildoers?
  
17. If the LORD had not been my help, my soul would soon have lived in the
  land of silence.
  
18. When I thought, "My foot slips," your steadfast love, O LORD, held me
  up.
  
19. When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul.
  
20. Can wicked rulers be allied with you, those who frame injustice by
  statute?
  
21. They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the
  innocent to death.
  
22. But the LORD has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my
  refuge.
  
23. He will bring back on them their iniquity and wipe them out for their
  wickedness; the LORD our God will wipe them out.

PSALMS 124
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. If it had not been the LORD who was on our side--let Israel now say--
  
2. if it had not been the LORD who was on our side when people rose up
  against us,
  
3. then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their anger was
  kindled against us;
  
4. then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone
  over us;
  
5. then over us would have gone the raging waters.
  
6. Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth!
  
7. We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare
  is broken, and we have escaped!
  
8. Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
