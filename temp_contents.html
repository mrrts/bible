JOHN 3:16-17
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16. "This is how much God loved the world: He gave his Son, his one and
  only Son. And this is why: so that no one need be destroyed; by
  believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life.
  
17. God didn't go to all the trouble of sending his Son merely to point an
  accusing finger, telling the world how bad it was. He came to help, to
  put the world right again.
