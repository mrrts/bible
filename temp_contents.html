<h2>PROVERBS 16
</h2>
<p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>1.</span> Mortals make elaborate plans, but GOD has the last word.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>2.</span> Humans are satisfied with whatever looks good; GOD probes for what is
   good.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>3.</span> Put GOD in charge of your work, then what you've planned will take
   place.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>4.</span> GOD made everything with a place and purpose; even the wicked are
   included--but for judgment.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>5.</span> GOD can't stomach arrogance or pretense; believe me, he'll put those
   upstarts in their place.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>6.</span> Guilt is banished through love and truth; Fear-of-GOD deflects evil.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>7.</span> When GOD approves of your life, even your enemies will end up shaking
   your hand.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>8.</span> Far better to be right and poor than to be wrong and rich.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>9.</span> We plan the way we want to live, but only GOD makes us able to live
   it.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>10.</span> A good leader motivates, doesn't mislead, doesn't exploit.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>11.</span> GOD cares about honesty in the workplace; your business is his
    business.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>12.</span> Good leaders abhor wrongdoing of all kinds; sound leadership has a
    moral foundation.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>13.</span> Good leaders cultivate honest speech; they love advisors who tell them
    the truth.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>14.</span> An intemperate leader wreaks havoc in lives; you're smart to stay
    clear of someone like that.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>15.</span> Good-tempered leaders invigorate lives; they're like spring rain and
    sunshine.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>16.</span> Get wisdom--it's worth more than money; choose insight over income
    every time.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>17.</span> The road of right living bypasses evil; watch your step and save your
    life.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>18.</span> First pride, then the crash--the bigger the ego, the harder the fall.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>19.</span> It's better to live humbly among the poor than to live it up among the
    rich and famous.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>20.</span> It pays to take life seriously; things work out when you trust in GOD.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>21.</span> A wise person gets known for insight; gracious words add to one's
    reputation.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>22.</span> True intelligence is a spring of fresh water, while fools sweat it out
    the hard way.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>23.</span> They make a lot of sense, these wise folks; whenever they speak, their
    reputation increases.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>24.</span> Gracious speech is like clover honey--good taste to the soul, quick
    energy for the body.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>25.</span> There's a way that looks harmless enough; look again--it leads
    straight to hell.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>26.</span> Appetite is an incentive to work; hunger makes you work all the
    harder.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>27.</span> Mean people spread mean gossip; their words smart and burn.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>28.</span> Troublemakers start fights; gossips break up friendships.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>29.</span> Calloused climbers betray their very own friends; they'd stab their
    own grandmothers in the back.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>30.</span> A shifty eye betrays an evil intention; a clenched jaw signals trouble
    ahead.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>31.</span> Gray hair is a mark of distinction, the award for a God-loyal life.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>32.</span> Moderation is better than muscle, self-control better than political
    power.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>33.</span> Make your motions and cast your votes, but GOD has the final say.

<span class='verse_number'>1.</span> Keep me safe, O God, I've run for dear life to you.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>2.</span> I say to GOD, "Be my Lord!" Without you, nothing makes sense.
   </p><p class='verse'>

<span class='verse_number'>10.</span> You canceled my ticket to hell--that's not my destination!
    </p><p class='verse'>

    of your face. Ever since you took my hand, I'm on the right way. A

<span class='verse_number'>1.</span> God is a safe place to hide, ready to help when we need him.

<span class='verse_number'>2.</span> We stand fearless at the cliff-edge of doom, courageous in seastorm
   and earthquake,

<p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>1.</span> God is well-known in Judah; in Israel, he's a household name.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>2.</span> He keeps a house in Salem, his own suite of rooms in Zion.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>3.</span> That's where, using arrows for kindling, he made a bonfire of weapons
   of war.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>4.</span> Oh, how bright you shine! Outshining their huge piles of loot!
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>5.</span> The warriors were plundered and left there impotent. And now there's
   nothing to them, nothing to show for their swagger and threats.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>6.</span> Your sudden roar, God of Jacob, knocked the wind out of horse and
   rider.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>7.</span> Fierce you are, and fearsome! Who can stand up to your rising anger?
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>8.</span> From heaven you thunder judgment; earth falls to her knees and holds
   her breath.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>9.</span> God stands tall and makes things right, he saves all the wretched on
   earth.
   </p><p class='verse'>

    a garland for God!
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>11.</span> Do for GOD what you said you'd do--he is, after all, your God. Let

<h2>PSALMS 106
</h2>
<p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>1.</span> Hallelujah! Thank GOD! And why? Because he's good, because his love
   lasts.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>2.</span> But who on earth can do it--declaim GOD's mighty acts, broadcast all
   his praises?
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>3.</span> You're one happy man when you do what's right, one happy woman when
   you form the habit of justice.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>4.</span> Remember me, GOD, when you enjoy your people; include me when you save
   them;
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>5.</span> I want to see your chosen succeed, celebrate with your celebrating
   nation, join the Hallelujahs of your pride and joy!
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>6.</span> We've sinned a lot, both we and our parents; We've fallen short, hurt
   a lot of people.
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>7.</span> After our parents left Egypt, they took your wonders for granted,
   forgot your great and wonderful love. They were barely beyond the Red
   Sea when they defied the High God
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>8.</span> -the very place he saved them! -the place he revealed his amazing
   power!
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>9.</span> He rebuked the Red Sea so that it dried up on the spot -he paraded
   them right through! -no one so much as got wet feet!
   </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>10.</span> He saved them from a life of oppression, pried them loose from the
    grip of the enemy.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>11.</span> Then the waters flowed back on their oppressors; there wasn't a single
    survivor.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>12.</span> Then they believed his words were true and broke out in songs of
    praise.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>13.</span> But it wasn't long before they forgot the whole thing, wouldn't wait
    to be told what to do.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>14.</span> They only cared about pleasing themselves in that desert, provoked God
    with their insistent demands.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>15.</span> He gave them exactly what they asked for--but along with it they got
    an empty heart.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>16.</span> One day in camp some grew jealous of Moses, also of Aaron, holy priest
    of GOD.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>17.</span> The ground opened and swallowed Dathan, then buried Abiram's gang.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>18.</span> Fire flared against that rebel crew and torched them to a cinder.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>19.</span> They cast in metal a bull calf at Horeb and worshiped the statue
    they'd made.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>20.</span> They traded the Glory for a cheap piece of sculpture--a grass-chewing
    bull!
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>21.</span> They forgot God, their very own Savior, who turned things around in
    Egypt,
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>22.</span> Who created a world of wonders in the Land of Ham, who gave that
    stunning performance at the Red Sea.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>23.</span> Fed up, God decided to get rid of them--and except for Moses, his
    chosen, he would have. But Moses stood in the gap and deflected God's
    anger, prevented it from destroying them utterly.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>24.</span> They went on to reject the Blessed Land, didn't believe a word of what
    God promised.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>25.</span> They found fault with the life they had and turned a deaf ear to GOD's
    voice.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>26.</span> Exasperated, God swore that he'd lay them low in the desert,
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>27.</span> Scattering their children hither and yon, strewing them all over the
    earth.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>28.</span> Then they linked up with Baal Peor, attending funeral banquets and
    eating idol food.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>29.</span> That made God so angry that a plague spread through their ranks;
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>30.</span> Phinehas stood up and pled their case and the plague was stopped.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>31.</span> This was counted to his credit; his descendants will never forget it.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>32.</span> They angered God again at Meribah Springs; this time Moses got mixed
    up in their evil;
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>33.</span> Because they defied GOD yet again, Moses exploded and lost his temper.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>34.</span> They didn't wipe out those godless cultures as ordered by GOD;
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>35.</span> Instead they intermarried with the heathen, and in time became just
    like them.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>36.</span> They worshiped their idols, were caught in the trap of idols.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>37.</span> They sacrificed their sons and daughters at the altars of demon gods.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>38.</span> They slit the throats of their babies, murdered their infant girls and
    boys. They offered their babies to Canaan's gods; the blood of their
    babies stained the land.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>39.</span> Their way of life stank to high heaven; they lived like whores.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>40.</span> And GOD was furious--a wildfire anger; he couldn't stand even to look
    at his people.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>41.</span> He turned them over to the heathen so that the people who hated them
    ruled them.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>42.</span> Their enemies made life hard for them; they were tyrannized under that
    rule.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>43.</span> Over and over God rescued them, but they never learned--until finally
    their sins destroyed them.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>44.</span> Still, when God saw the trouble they were in and heard their cries for
    help,
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>45.</span> He remembered his Covenant with them, and, immense with love, took
    them by the hand.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>46.</span> He poured out his mercy on them while their captors looked on, amazed.
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>47.</span> Save us, GOD, our God! Gather us back out of exile So we can give
    thanks to your holy name and join in the glory when you are praised!
    </p><p class='verse'>
<span class='verse_number'>48.</span> Blessed be GOD, Israel's God! Bless now, bless always! Oh! Let
    everyone say Amen! Hallelujah! al
